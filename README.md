# CS569 Workshop 02
For this workshop, use Angular and create a unit converter application that shows the following screens:
* Length - Default (cm to inches and inches to cm) + (m to ft and ft to m) + (km to miles and miles to km)
* Temperature (F to C and C to F)
* Area (sqm to sqft and vise versa)
* History (store all previous client conversions and show them as a table from/to) with an option to delete one/all.
  
Check [Angular Resources UI Kits](https://angular.io/resources?category=development) and use one of the UI components. 
  
### Length
* cm to inches: divide the length value by 2.54
* cm to feet: divide the length value by 30.48
* cm to miles: divide the length value by 160934
* m to inches: multiply the length value by 39.37
* m to feet: multiply the length value by 3.281
* m to miles: divide the length value by 1609
* km to inches: multiply the length value by 39370
* km to feet: multiply the length value by 3281
* km to miles: divide the length value by 1.609
### Temperature
* F to C: (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
* C to F: (0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F
### Area
* sqm to sqft: multiply the area value by 10.764
* sqft to sqm: divide the area value by 10.764

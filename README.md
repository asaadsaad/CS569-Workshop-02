# CS569 Workshop 02
For this workshop, you will update `Homework 11` to be using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) and replace your native HTML elements with Material components. First, you will need to [install the package](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) and as you read through the documentation, it is composed of multiple modules, it is advisable to create a `MaterialModule` that encapsulates *(imports/exports)* all other Material modules.  
  
**Requirements:** Use the Material components for your buttons, table, and form elements.  
  
Good luck.
